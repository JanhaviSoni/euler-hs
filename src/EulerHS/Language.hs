This module provides you a public interface to the free monadic eDSLs of the framework.

The `Flow` type or its derivations for different monad stacks can be used
to describe business logic of a typical web application.

This language provides you with several features out-of-the-box:

- Logging
- SQL DB subsystem. Supported SQL DB backends:
  * MySQL
  * Postgres
  * SQLite
- KV DB subsystem (Redis)
- Fork/await of flows (async evaluation)
- Typed options
- Servant-like HTTP client runner
- Low-level HTTP client runner
- Arbitrary IO effects
- Exception throwing and handling
- Redis-based PubSub connector (experimental)

The `Flow` is a monad, so you can write sequential scenarios in a monadic form:

@
import EulerHS.Prelude
import qualified EulerHS.Types as T
import qualified EulerHS.Language as L
import qualified Servant.Client as S

myFlow :: L.Flow (Either T.ClientError User)
myFlow = do
  L.runIO $ putStrLn @String "Hello there!"
  L.logInfo "myFlow" "This is a message from myFlow."

  let url = S.BaseUrl Http "127.0.0.1" 8081 ""
  L.callAPI Nothing url getUser

-- HTTP API powered by Servant
type API = "user" :> Get '[JSON] User

getUser :: T.EulerClient User
getUser = client api
@

To run this logic, you need to create an instance of `FlowRuntime`,
and pass @myFlow@ to the `runFlow` method.

This module is better imported as qualified.
